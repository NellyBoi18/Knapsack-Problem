# Knapsack Problem
Implements an algorithm for the Knapsack Problem in C. The algorithm is efficient and takes O(nW) time, where n is the number of items and W is the capacity.

# Input:
Read from standard input. The input will start with a positive integer, giving the number of instances that follow. For each instance, there will be two positive integers, representing the number of items and the capactity, followed by a list describing the items. For each item, there will be two nonngeative integers, representing the weight and value, respectively. 

# Output:
For each instance, the program outputs the maximum possible value.

# Sample:
**Input:**\
2\
1 3\
4 100\
3 4\
1 2\
3 3\
2 4

**Output:**\
0\
6

The sample input has two instances. The first instance has one item and a capacity of 3. The item has weight 4 and value 100. The second instance has three items and a capacity of 4.
